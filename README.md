# CovidBlaster

## Project Description
For our project, our team will build a single player 2d platform survival game based around the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Our game will revolve around a player controlled character, who wields a hand sanitizer gun to attack Covid-19 infected 
zombies while wearing a mask as armor. Our game will be survival based, with the player controlled character’s health 
revolving around how much health their mask has. As the game goes on, the difficulty of the game increases with zombies 
moving faster and becoming stronger as infection of the virus spreads. Parallel to this, the player character will be able 
to get stronger by finding upgraded masks and weapons as rewards. The goal of the game is to “disinfect” as many zombies as 
possible in each given round. There will be high scores and the player will try to beat each given “wave” of zombies. The 
longer the game lasts, the higher your score will accumulate to. The game ends when a player loses all the health in their 
mask and becomes infected. At the end of the game, there will be a summary of the last “wave” you survived to, the score you 
received, the current high score, and disinfection/other stats received from the most recent session played.

Our goal is to eventually release the game onto steam or other gaming platforms.We mainly want to create the key features of
the game on Pygame before we are able to use other program systems to refine the game and make it easily accessible. In the 
end we want to deliver a survival game where players must avoid and kill infected in order to survive while keeping track of 
their highscore. Other features such as upgrades, weapons, and levels are added on features to make the game more challenging 
and enjoyable for the players.
